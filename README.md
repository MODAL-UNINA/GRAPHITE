# GRAPHITE - Generative Reasoning and Analysis for Predictive Handling in Traffic Efficiency

## Abstract
Traffic forecasting is a crucial aspect of modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), playing a vital role in improving the safety and efficiency of daily transportation activities. Despite the valuable contributions of traditional machine learning (ML) models and advanced deep learning (DL) techniques, there persist challenges in capturing the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in traffic flow.

In response to these challenges, we present **GRAPHITE**, an innovative framework that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to leverage generative reasoning for efficient traffic management. Our model integrates historical traffic volume data collected by road sensors with local spatial information encoded through knowledge graphs (KGs), capturing relationships between sensors and nearby points of interest (POIs).

Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets underscore the efficacy of GRAPHITE. Notably, we achieved a maximum decrease in RMSE of 31.05% compared to GAN-GRU and a maximum increase in R¬≤ of 8.15% compared to GAN-RNN, positioning GRAPHITE as a standout solution among current state-of-the-art approaches.
